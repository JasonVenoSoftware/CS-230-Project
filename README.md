# CS-230-Project

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room had an Android app that they wished to make compatible with several other platforms by making it a web-based version of the game.  It was a game called Draw It Or Lose Itwhere multiple teams try to guess what an image is of as it is drawn.  Specifically, they wanted it to be compatible with Mac, Linux, Windows, and various mobile devices.  

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My best work in this documentation was the "Domain Model" section, where each type of object in the game was well described and well documented.  This made it easy to look back at exactly what the game needed to be able to do when working on other parts of the document.  

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating a design document made the entire program much more understandable, and allowed an easier flow of progress when designing the program.  A quick look at this document made everything clear, and aided every future step of creating the program.  

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The "Evaluation" section could use some revision, because since I wrote it, I have learned a lot more about Windows, Linux, Mac, and mobile devices.  Also, I did not include anything about which one would've been the best for The Gaming Room, which was the entire purpose of the document. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The design document was modeled around the users needs, in this case evaluating which of their chosen operating systems would be best for them.  If their needs weren't met, then the program wouldn't meet their goals, and the project would overall fail.  They may request that we remake it, or they could ask a different company for work.  

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Designing the software involved careful studying of the UML Diagram and the "Domain Model" section of the design document, because they both visualize how exactly the software must be laid out.  For example, it informs us that there can be any number of players in a team, and any number of teams in a game.  Once this "zero-to-many" relationship has been defined, correctly designing the software was much more straightforward.  In the future, I would pay even more attention to the design document, and try to catch the little details before even beginning to design the software.
